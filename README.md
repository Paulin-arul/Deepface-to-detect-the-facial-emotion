# Deepface-to-detect-the-facial-emotion

## Overview
This project uses the DeepFace library to detect facial emotions in images. DeepFace is a powerful deep learning library designed for facial recognition and analysis, which can accurately detect emotions from facial expressions in images.

## Features
- Detects emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.
- Easy to set up and use
- Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for accurate emotion detection

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Paulin-arul/Deepface-to-detect-the-facial-emotion.git
    cd Deepface-to-detect-the-facial-emotion
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install deepface
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

## Usage
